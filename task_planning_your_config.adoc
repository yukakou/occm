When you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS, you can choose a preconfigured system that matches your workload requirements, or you can create your own configuration. If you choose your own configuration, you should understand the options available to you.

== Viewing supported regions

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported in most AWS regions. https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[View the full list of supported regions^].

Newer AWS regions must be enabled before you can create and manage resources in those regions. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html[Learn how to enable a region^].

== Choosing a license type

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in two pricing options: pay-as-you-go and Bring Your Own License (BYOL). For pay-as-you-go, you can choose from three licenses: Explore, Standard, or Premium. Each license provides different capacity and compute options.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_configs_aws_98.html[Supported configurations for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 in AWS^]

== Choosing a supported instance

Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports several instance types, depending on the license type that you choose.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_configs_aws_98.html[Supported configurations for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 in AWS^]

== Choosing a configuration that supports Flash Cache

Some Cloud Volumes ONTAP configurations in AWS include local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_ for better performance. link:concept_flash_cache.html[Learn more about Flash Cache].

== Understanding storage limits

The raw capacity limit for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is tied to the license. Additional limits impact the size of aggregates and volumes. You should be aware of these limits as you plan your configuration.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_limits_aws_98.html[Storage limits for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 in AWS]

== Sizing your system in AWS

Sizing your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system can help you meet requirements for performance and capacity. You should be aware of a few key points when choosing an instance type, disk type, and disk size:

Instance type::
* Match your workload requirements to the maximum throughput and IOPS for each EC2 instance type.
* If several users write to the system at the same time, choose an instance type that has enough CPUs to manage the requests.
* If you have an application that is mostly reads, then choose a system with enough RAM.
** https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/[AWS Documentation: Amazon EC2 Instance Types^]
** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSOptimized.html[AWS Documentation: Amazon EBS–Optimized Instances^]

EBS disk type::
General Purpose SSDs are the most common disk type for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. To view the use cases for EBS disks, refer to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html[AWS Documentation: EBS Volume Types^].

EBS disk size::
You need to choose an initial disk size when you launch a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. After that, you can link:concept_storage_management.html[let Cloud Manager manage a system's capacity for you], but if you want to link:task_provisioning_storage.html#creating-aggregates[build aggregates yourself], be aware of the following:

** All disks in an aggregate must be the same size.
** The performance of EBS disks is tied to disk size. The size determines the baseline IOPS and maximum burst duration for SSD disks and the baseline and burst throughput for HDD disks.
** Ultimately, you should choose the disk size that gives you the _sustained performance_ that you need.
** Even if you do choose larger disks (for example, six 4 TB disks), you might not get all of the IOPS because the EC2 instance can reach its bandwidth limit.

For more details about EBS disk performance, refer to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html[AWS Documentation: EBS Volume Types^].

== Preparing to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in an AWS Outpost

If you have an AWS Outpost, you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in that Outpost by selecting the Outpost VPC in the Working Environment wizard. The experience is the same as any other VPC that resides in AWS. Note that you will need to first deploy a Connector in your AWS Outpost.

There are a few limitations to point out:

* Only single node Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems are supported at this time
* The EC2 instances that you can use with Cloud Volumes ONTAP are limited to what's available in your Outpost
* Only General Purpose SSDs are supported at this time

== AWS network information worksheet

When you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS, you need to specify details about your VPC network. You can use a worksheet to collect the information from your administrator.

== Choosing a write speed

Cloud Manager enables you to choose a write speed setting for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Before you choose a write speed, you should understand the differences between the normal and high settings and risks and recommendations when using high write speed. link:concept_write_speed.html[Learn more about write speed].

== Choosing a volume usage profile

ONTAP includes several storage efficiency features that can reduce the total amount of storage that you need. When you create a volume in Cloud Manager, you can choose a profile that enables these features or a profile that disables them. You should learn more about these features to help you decide which profile to use.

NetApp storage efficiency features provide the following benefits:

Thin provisioning:: Presents more logical storage to hosts or users than you actually have in your physical storage pool. Instead of preallocating storage space, storage space is allocated dynamically to each volume as data is written.

Deduplication:: Improves efficiency by locating identical blocks of data and replacing them with references to a single shared block. This technique reduces storage capacity requirements by eliminating redundant blocks of data that reside in the same volume.

Compression:: Reduces the physical capacity required to store data by compressing data within a volume on primary, secondary, and archive storage.
