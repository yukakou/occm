== Cloud Manager 3.8.9 (4 Oct 2020)

* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Volumes Service for AWS enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Sync integration>>
* <<Account management enhancements>>
* <<Changes for Government regions>>

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

* A new *Cloud Compliance Viewer* role is available in Cloud Manager.
+
Users who are assigned this role can only view compliance information and generate reports for workspaces that they have permission to access. They cannot manage Cloud Compliance settings and they cannot access any other Cloud Manager features and services. This may be the perfect role for your legal team so they can monitor Cloud Compliance scan results. See link:reference_user_roles.html[user roles] for details.

* Added support to scan MongoDB and PostgreSQL database schemas. See link:task_scanning_databases.html[scanning database schemas] for more information.

* Cloud Compliance pricing is changing as of October 7th.
+
The first 1 TB of data that Cloud Compliance scans in a Cloud Manager workspace is free. This includes data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes, Azure NetApp Files volumes, Amazon S3 buckets, and database schemas. A subscription is required to scan any additional data after you reach 1 TB. See link:https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-compliance#pricing[pricing^] for details.

=== Cloud Volumes Service for AWS enhancements

When creating a new volume, you can choose to base that volume on an existing Snapshot copy of another volume.

=== Cloud Sync integration

NetApp’s Cloud Sync service is now available from within Cloud Manager. Cloud Sync offers a simple, secure, and automated way to migrate your data from any source destination to any target destination, in the cloud or on your premises.

link:concept_cloud_sync.html[Learn more].

=== Account management enhancements

We've added more ways to manage your account.

* An overview of your account resources is now available.
+
You can quickly view the number of users, workspaces, Connectors, and subscriptions in your account.
* You can change the name of your account.
* You can copy your account ID, workspace ID, or Connector ID.
+
Copying these IDs will help with automation features that we're planning.
* You can disable use of the SaaS platform.
+
We don't recommend disabling the SaaS platform unless you need to in order to comply with your company's security policies. Disabling the SaaS platform limits your ability to use NetApp's integrated cloud services. link:task_managing_cloud_central_accounts[Learn more].

image:screenshot_account_management.gif[]

=== Changes for Government regions

If you deploy a Connector in an AWS GovCloud region, an Azure Gov region, or an Azure DoD region, access to Cloud Manager is now available only through a Connector's host IP address. Access to the SaaS platform is disabled for the entire account.

This means that only privileged users who can access the end-user internal VPC/VNet can use Cloud Manager's UI or API.

link:reference_limitations.html[Learn more about this limitation].

== Cloud Manager 3.8.8 update (22 Sept 2020)

* <<Azure NetApp Files enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Volumes Service for AWS enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>
* <<Backup to Cloud enhancements>>
* <<Support for Global File Cache>>

=== New software-as-a-service experience

We have fully introduced a software-as-a-service experience for Cloud Manager. This new experience makes it easier for you to use Cloud Manager and enables us to provide additional features to manage your hybrid cloud infrastructure.

Cloud Manager includes a https://cloudmanager.netapp.com/[SaaS-based interface^] that is integrated with NetApp Cloud Central, and Connectors that enable Cloud Manager to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. (The Connector is actually the same as the existing Cloud Manager software that you have installed.)

NOTE: A Connector is required in most cases, but it's not required to use Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Volumes Service, or Cloud Sync from Cloud Manager.

As previously mentioned in these release notes, you'll need to upgrade the machine type for your Connectors to access the new capabilities that we're offering. Cloud Manager will prompt you with instructions to change the machine type. link:concept_saas.html#the-local-user-interface[Learn more].

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements

Two enhancements are available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

* *Multiple BYOL licenses to allocate additional capacity*
+
You can now purchase multiple licenses for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system to allocate more than 368 TB of capacity. For example, you might purchase two licenses to allocate up to 736 TB of capacity to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Or you could purchase four licenses to get up to 1.4 PB.
+
The number of licenses that you can purchase for a single node system or HA pair is unlimited.
+
Be aware that disk limits can prevent you from reaching the capacity limit by using disks alone. You can go beyond the disk limit by link:concept_data_tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage^]. For information about disk limits, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/[storage limits in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^].
+

+
You can now encrypt Azure managed disks on single node Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems using external keys from another account. This feature is supported using APIs.
+
You just need to add the following to the API request when creating the single node system:
+
[source,json]
"azureEncryptionParameters": {
      "key": <azure id of encryptionset>
  }
+
This feature requires new permissions as shown in the latest https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_cloud_Manager_Azure_3.8.7.json[Cloud Manager policy for Azure^].

The following enhancements are now available for Backup to Cloud.

* *Bring Your Own License (BYOL) is now available*
+
Backup to Cloud has been available only with a Pay As You Go (PAYGO) license. A BYOL license allows you to purchase a license from NetApp to use Backup to Cloud for a certain period of time and for a maximum amount backup space. When either limit is reached you will need to renew the license.
+
link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html#cost[Learn more about the new Backup to Cloud BYOL license.^]

* *Support for data protection (DP) volumes*
+
Data protection volumes can be backed up and restored now.

=== Support for Global File Cache

NetApp Global File Cache enables you to consolidate silos of distributed file servers into one cohesive global storage footprint in the public cloud. This creates a globally accessible file system in the cloud that all distributed locations can use as if they were local.

Starting with this release, the Global File Cache Management instance and Core instance can be deployed and managed through Cloud Manager. This saves many hours during your initial deployment process and provides a single pane of glass through Cloud Manager for this and other deployed systems. Global File Cache Edge instances are still deployed locally at your remote offices.

See link:concept_gfc.html[Global File Cache overview^] for more information.

The initial configuration that can be deployed using Cloud Manager must meet the following requirements. Other configurations like Cloud Volumes Service, Azure NetApp Files, and Cloud Volumes Service for AWS and GCP continue to be deployed using the legacy procedures. https://cloud.netapp.com/global-file-cache/onboarding[Learn more^].

* The backend storage platform that is used as your central storage must be a working environment where you have deployed a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair in Azure.
+
Other storage platforms and other cloud providers are not supported at this time using Cloud Manager but can be deployed using legacy deployment procedures.

* The GFC Core can be deployed only as a stand-alone instance.
+
If you need to use a Load Distributed design that includes multiple Core instances you must use the legacy procedures.

This feature requires new permissions as shown in the latest https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_cloud_Manager_Azure_3.8.7.json[Cloud Manager policy for Azure^].

== Improved experience requires stronger machine type (15 July 2020)

As we improve the Cloud Manager experience, you'll need to upgrade your machine type to access the new capabilities that we'll be offering. The improvements will include a link:concept_saas.html[software-as-a-service experience for Cloud Manager] and new and enhanced cloud service integrations.

Cloud Manager will prompt you with instructions to change the machine type.

Here are some details:

. To ensure adequate resources are available for proper functionality of the new features in Cloud Manager, we've changed the default instance, VM, and machine type as follows:
+
* AWS: t3.xlarge
* Azure: DS3 v2
* GCP: n1-standard-4
+
These default sizes are the minimum supported link:reference_cloud_mgr_reqs.html[based on CPU and RAM requirements].

. As part of this transition, Cloud Manager requires access to the following endpoint so it can obtain software images of container components for a Docker infrastructure:
+
\https://cloudmanagerinfraprod.azurecr.io
+
Ensure that your firewall enables access to this endpoint from Cloud Manager.

=== Enhancements to accounts and subscriptions

We've made it easier to select an AWS account or GCP project and an associated marketplace subscription for a pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. These enhancements help to ensure that you're paying from the right account or project.

For example, when you create a system in AWS, click *Edit Credentials* if you don't want to use the default account and subscription:

image:screenshot_accounts_select_aws.gif[A screenshot of the Details & Credentials page in the working environment wizard that shows the Edit Credentials button.]

From there, you can choose the account credentials that you want to use and the associated AWS marketplace subscription. You can even add a marketplace subscription, if you need to.

And if you manage multiple AWS subscriptions, you can assign each one of them to different AWS credentials from the Credentials page in the settings:

=== Timeline enhancements

The Timeline was enhanced to provide you with more information about the NetApp cloud services that you use.

* The Timeline now shows actions for all Cloud Manager systems within the same Cloud Central account
* You can now find information more easily by filtering, searching, and adding and removing columns
* You can now download the timeline data in CSV format
* In the future, the Timeline will show actions for each NetApp cloud service that you use (but you can filter the information down to a single service)

== Cloud Manager 3.8 (8 Jan 2020)

* <<HA enhancements in Azure>>
* <<Data tiering enhancements in GCP>>

=== HA enhancements in Azure

The following enhancements are now available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pairs in Azure.

* *Override CIFS locks for Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA in Azure*
+
You can now enable a setting in Cloud Manager that prevents issues with Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage failover during Azure maintenance events. When you enable this setting, Cloud Volumes ONTAP vetoes CIFS locks and resets active CIFS sessions. link:task_overriding_cifs_locks.html[Learn more].

* *HTTPS connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to storage accounts*
+
You can now enable an HTTPS connection from a Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 HA pair to Azure storage accounts when creating a working environment. Note that enabling this option can impact write performance. You can't change the setting after you create the working environment.

* *Support for Azure general-purpose v2 storage accounts*
+
The storage accounts that Cloud Manager creates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 HA pairs are now general-purpose v2 storage accounts.

=== Data tiering enhancements in GCP

The following enhancements are available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP data tiering in GCP.

* *Google Cloud storage classes for data tiering*
+
You can now choose a storage class for data that Cloud Volumes ONTAP tiers to Google Cloud Storage:
+
** Standard Storage (default)
** Nearline Storage
** Coldline Storage
+

link:task_tiering.html#changing-the-storage-class-for-tiered-data[Learn how to change the storage class for Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

* *Data tiering using a service account*
+
Starting with the 9.7 release, Cloud Manager now sets a service account on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. This service account provides permissions for data tiering to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. This change provides more security and requires less setup. For step-by-step instructions when deploying a new system, link:task_getting_started_gcp.html[see step 4 on this page].
