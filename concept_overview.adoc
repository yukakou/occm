== Cloud Manager

Cloud Manager was built with simplicity in mind. It guides you through Cloud Volumes ONTAP setup in a few quick steps, eases data management by offering simplified storage provisioning and automated capacity management, enables drag-and-drop data replication across a hybrid cloud, and more.

Cloud Manager is required to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP, but it can also discover and provision storage for on-premises ONTAP clusters. This provides a central point of control for your cloud and on-premises storage infrastructure.

Cloud Manager also offers insight into your AWS cloud storage. The Cloud Storage Automation feature analyzes your cloud storage to show you savings opportunities, data protection enhancements, and operations that can optimize the cloud storage associated with your AWS account.

You can run Cloud Manager in the cloud or in your network—it just needs a connection to the networks in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP. The following image shows Cloud Manager running in AWS and managing Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in AWS and Azure. It also shows data replication across a hybrid cloud.

== Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is a software-only storage appliance that runs the ONTAP data management software in the cloud. You can use Cloud Volumes ONTAP for production workloads, disaster recovery, DevOps, file shares, and database management.

Cloud Volumes ONTAP extends enterprise storage to the cloud with the following key features:

* Storage efficiencies
Leverage built-in data deduplication, data compression, thin provisioning, and cloning to minimize storage costs.

* High availability
Ensure enterprise reliability and continuous operations in case of failures in your cloud environment (AWS only).

* Data replication
Cloud Volumes ONTAP leverages SnapMirror, NetApp’s industry-leading replication technology, to replicate on-premises data to the cloud so it’s easy to have secondary copies available for multiple use cases.

* Data tiering
Switch between high and low-performance storage pools on-demand without taking applications offline.

* Application consistency
Ensure consistency of NetApp Snapshot copies using the NetApp SnapManager tool suite.

NOTE: Licenses for ONTAP features are included with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
