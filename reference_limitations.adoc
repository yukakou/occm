== Active Directory not supported by default with new installations of Cloud Manager

Starting with version 3.4, new installations of Cloud Manager do not support using your organization's Active Directory authentication for user management. If needed, NetApp can help you set up Active Directory with Cloud Manager. Click the chat icon in the lower right of Cloud Manager to get assistance.

== Limitations with the AWS GovCloud (US) region

* Cloud Manager must be deployed in the AWS GovCloud (US) region if you want to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances in the AWS GovCloud (US) region.

* When deployed in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, Cloud Manager cannot discover ONTAP clusters in a NetApp Private Storage for Microsoft Azure configuration or a NetApp Private Storage for SoftLayer configuration.

== Volume View limitations

* The Volume View is not supported in the AWS GovCloud (US) region, in the AWS Commercial Cloud Services environment, and in Microsoft Azure.

* The Volume View enables you to create NFS volumes only.

* Cloud Manager does not launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL instances in the Volume View.

== Cloud Manager does not verify IP addresses of key managers

When you add a key manager to Cloud Manager, it does not verify the IP address that you entered because Cloud Manager does not communicate with key managers. If the IP address is incorrect, you are notified later when you try to create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment. Be sure to verify key manager IP addresses after you enter them.

== Cloud Manager does not set up iSCSI volumes

When you create a volume in Cloud Manager using the Storage System View, you can choose the NFS or CIFS protocol. You must use OnCommand System Manager to create a volume for iSCSI.

== Storage Virtual Machine (SVM) limitation

Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports one data-serving SVM and one or more SVMs used for disaster recovery.

Cloud Manager does not provide any setup or orchestration support for SVM disaster recovery. It also does not support storage-related tasks on any additional SVMs. You must use System Manager or the CLI for SVM disaster recovery.
