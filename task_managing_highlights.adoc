Cloud Compliance provides many ways for you to manage your private data. Some functionality just makes it easier to see the data that is most important to you, and other functionality allows you to make changes to the data.

* Using the "highlight" functionality you can create your own custom search queries so that you can easily see the results by clicking one button.
* You can send email alerts to Cloud Manager users when certain critical highlights return results.
* If you are subscribed to link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/information-protection/[Azure Information Protection (AIP)^] to classify and protect your files, you can use Cloud Compliance to manage those AIP labels.
* You can delete files that seem insecure or too risky to leave in your storage system.

See below for more functionality that is provided with both the highlights and AIP features.

== Controlling your data using Highlights

Highlights are like a favorites list of custom filters that provide search results in the Investigation page for commonly requested compliance queries. Cloud Compliance provides a set of predefined Highlights based on common customer questions. You can also create custom Highlights that provide results for searches specific to your organization.

Highlights provide the following functionality:

* <<List of predefined highlights,Predefined highlights>> from NetApp based on user requests
* Ability to create your own custom highlights
* Launch the Investigation page with the results from your highlights in one click
* Send email alerts to Cloud Manager users when certain critical highlights return results so you can get notifications to protect your data
* Assign AIP (Azure Information Protection) labels automatically to all files that match the criteria defined in a highlight

The *Highlights* tab in the Compliance Dashboard lists all the Highlights available on this instance of Cloud Compliance.

In addition, Highlights appear in the list of Filters in the Investigation page.

=== Viewing highlights results in the Investigation page

To display the results for a highlight in the Investigation page, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button for a specific highlight, and then select *Investigate Results*.

=== Creating custom highlights

You can create your own custom highlights that provide results for searches specific to your organization.

.Steps

. From the Data Investigation page, define your search by selecting all the filters you want to use. See link:task_controlling_private_data.html#filtering-data-in-the-data-investigation-page[Filtering data in the Data Investigation page^] for details.

. Once you have all the filter characteristics just the way you want them, click *Save this search as a Highlight*.

image:screenshot_compliance_save_as_highlight.png[A screenshot showing how to save a filtered query as a Highlight.]

. Name the highlight and select other actions that can be performed by the highlight:
.. Enter a unique name and description.
.. Optionally, check the box if you want notification emails sent to Cloud Manager users, and choose the interval at which the email is sent.
.. Optionally, check the box to automatically assign AIP labels to files that match the highlight parameters, and select the label. (Learn more about <<Categorizing your data using AIP labels,AIP labels>>.)

.Result

The new highlight appears in the Highlights tab.

=== Editing highlights

You can modify certain parts of a highlight depending on the type of highlight:

* Custom highlights - You can modify the _Name_, the _Description_, whether email notifications are sent, and whether AIP labels are added.
* Predefined highlights - You can modify only whether email notifications are sent and whether AIP labels are added.

NOTE: If you need to change the filter parameters for a custom highlight, you'll need to create a new highlight with the parameters you want, and then delete the old highlight.

To modify a highlight, click the *Edit* button, enter your changes on the _Edit Highlight_ page, and click *Save Highlight*.

=== Deleting highlights

You can delete any custom highlight that you created if you no longer need it. You can't delete any of the predefined highlights.

To delete a highlight, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button for a specific highlight, click *Delete Highlight*, and then click *Delete Highlight* again in the confirmation dialog.

== Categorizing your data using AIP labels

You can manage AIP labels in the files that Cloud Compliance is scanning if you have subscribed to link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/information-protection/[Azure Information Protection (AIP)^]. AIP enables you to classify and protect documents and files by applying labels to content. Cloud Compliance enables you to view the labels that are already assigned to files, add labels to files, and change labels when a label already exists.

Cloud Compliance support AIP labels within the following file types: .PDF, .DOCX, .DOC, .PPTX, .XLS, .XLSX.

Note that you can't currently change labels in files larger than 30 MB. For OneDrive accounts the maximum file size is 4 MB.

TIP: If a file has a label which doesn’t exist anymore in AIP, Cloud Compliance considers it as a file without a label.

=== Integrating AIP labels in your workspace

Before you can manage AIP labels, you need to integrate the AIP label functionality into Cloud Compliance by signing into your existing Azure account. Once enabled, you can manage AIP labels within files for all link:concept_cloud_compliance.html#supported-working-environments-and-data-sources[working environments and data sources^] in your current Cloud Manager workspace.

.Requirements

* You must have an account and an Azure Information Protection license.
* You must have the login credentials for the Azure account.
* If you plan to change labels in files that reside in Amazon S3 buckets, ensure that the permission `s3:PutObject` is included in the IAM role. See link:task_scanning_s3.html#reviewing-s3-prerequisites[setting up the IAM role^].

.Steps

. From the Cloud Compliance Configuration page, click *Integrate AIP Labels*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_integrate_aip_labels.png[A screenshot that shows clicking the button to integrate AIP labels functionality into Cloud Compliance.]

. In the Integrate AIP Labels dialog, click *Sign in to Azure*.

. In the Microsoft page that appears, select the account and enter the required credentials.

. Return to the Cloud Compliance tab and you'll see the message "_AIP Labels were integrated successfully with the account <account_name>_".

. Click *Close* and you'll see the text _AIP Labels integrated_ at the top of the page.
+

=== Assigning AIP labels manually

You can add, change, and remove AIP labels from your files using Cloud Compliance.

Follow these steps to assign an AIP label to a single file.

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, click image:button_subfolder.png[right-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.

image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_manually.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]

. Click *Assign a Label to this file* and then select the label.
+
The label appears in the file metadata.

// NOTE: You can't remove a label when modifying AIP labels manually.

=== Assigning AIP labels automatically with highlights

You can assign an AIP label to all the files that meet the criteria of the highlight. You can specify the AIP label when creating the highlight, or you can add the label when editing any highlight.

Labels are added or updated in files continuously as Cloud Compliance scans your files.

Depending on whether a label is already applied to a file, and the classification level of the label, the following actions are taken when changing a label:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="65,35"]
|===

| If the file...
| Then...

| Has no label | The label is added
| Has an existing label of a lower level of classification | The higher level label is added
| Has an existing label of a higher level of classification |	The higher level label is retained
| Is assigned a label both manually and by a highlight | The higher level label is added
| Is assigned two different labels by two highlights |	The higher level label is added

|===

Follow these steps to add an AIP label to an existing highlight.

.Steps

. From the Highlights List page, click *Edit* for the highlight where you want to add (or change) the AIP label.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_highlight_1.png[A screenshot showing how to edit an existing highlight.]

. In the Edit Highlight page, check the box to enable automatic labels for files that match the highlight parameters, and select the label (for example, *General*).
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_highlight_2.png[A screenshot showing how to select the label to be assigned to files that match the highlight.]

. Click *Save Highlight* and the label appears in the highlight description.

NOTE: If a highlight was configured with a label, but the label has since been removed from AIP, the label name is turned to OFF and the label is not assigned anymore.

// You can remove a label by clicking the “None” option.

=== Removing the AIP integration

If you no longer want the ability to manage AIP labels in files, you can remove the AIP account from the Cloud Compliance interface.

Note that no changes are made to the labels you have added using Cloud Compliance. The labels that exist in files will stay as they currently exist.

.Steps

. From the _Scan Configuration_ page, click *AIP Labels integrated > Remove Integration*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_un_integrate_aip_labels.png[A screenshot showing how to remove AIP integrations with Cloud Compliance.]

. Click *Remove Integration* from the confirmation dialog.

== Sending email alerts when non-compliant data is found

Cloud Compliance can send email alerts to Cloud Manager users when certain critical highlights return results so you can get notifications to protect your data. You can choose to send the email notifications on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

You can configure this setting when creating the highlight or when editing any highlight.

Follow these steps to add email updates to an existing highlight.

.Steps

. From the Highlights List page, click *Edit* for the highlight where you want to add (or change) the email setting.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_email_alert_1.png[A screenshot showing how to edit an existing highlight.]

. In the Edit Highlight page, check the box if you want notification emails sent to Cloud Manager users, and choose the interval at which the email is sent (for example, *Week*).
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_email_alert_2.png[A screenshot showing how to choose the email criterial to be sent for the highlight.]

. Click *Save Highlight* and the interval at which the email is sent appears in the highlight description.

.Result

The first email is sent now if there are any results from the highlight - but only if any files meet the highlight criteria. No personal information is sent in the notification emails. The email indicates that there are files that match the highlight criteria, and it provides a link to the highlight results.

== Deleting source files

You can permanently remove source files that seem insecure or too risky to leave in your storage system. This action is permanent and there is no undo.

TIP: You can't delete files that reside in databases or files that reside in volume backup files.

.Steps

. In the Data Investigation results pane, click image:button_subfolder.png[right-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_delete_file.png[A screenshot showing selection of the Delete File button from the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]

. Click *Delete this file*.

. Because the delete operation is permanent, you must type "*permanently delete*" in the subsequent _Delete File_ dialog and click *Delete File*.
