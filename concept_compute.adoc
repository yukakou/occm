At a high-level, Cloud Analyzer integration with Cloud Manager works like this:

. You click *Compute* and connect your AWS master payer account.

. NetApp configures your environment as follows:

.. Creates an organization in the Spot platform.
.. Sends an email welcoming you to Spot.
+
You can log in to the Spot service using the same single-sign on credentials that you use with Cloud Central and Cloud Manager.
.. Cloud Analyzer starts processing your AWS account data.

. In Cloud Manager, the Compute page refreshes and you use the information to gain insights on past, current, and future cloud costs.

. You click *Get Full Analysis* at any time to go to Spot's Cloud Analyzer, which provides a full analysis of your cloud spend and savings opportunities.
