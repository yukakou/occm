When you log in to Cloud Manager for the first time, you're prompted to create a _NetApp Cloud Central account_. This account provides multi-tenancy and enables you to organize users and resources in isolated _workspaces_.

link:concept_cloud_central_accounts.html[Learn more about how Cloud Central accounts work].

Set up your Cloud Central account so users can access Cloud Manager and access the working environments in a workspace. Just add a single user or add multiple users and workspaces.

== Adding workspaces

In Cloud Manager, workspaces enable you to isolate a set of working environments from other working environments and from other users. For example, you can create two workspaces and associate separate users with each workspace.

.Steps

. From the top of Cloud Manager, click the *Account* drop-down.

. Click *Manage Account Settings* next to the currently selected account.

. Click *Workspaces*.

. Click *Add New Workspace*.

. Enter a name for the workspace and click *Add*.

.After you finish

If a Workspace Admin needs access to this workspace, then you'll need to associate the user. You'll also need to associate Connectors with the workspace so Workspace Admins can use those Connectors.

== Adding users

Associate Cloud Central users with the Cloud Central account so those users can create and manage working environments in Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. If the user hasn't already done so, ask the user to go to https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^] and sign up.

. From the top of Cloud Manager, click the *Account* drop-down.
+

. Click *Manage Account Settings* next to the currently selected account.
+
image:screenshot_manage_account_settings.gif[A screenshot that shows the Manage Account Settings option that's available from the Account drop-down.]

. From the Users tab, click *Associate User*.

. Enter the user's email address and select a role for the user:
+
* *Account Admin*: Can perform any action in Cloud Manager.
* *Workspace Admin*: Can create and manage resources in assigned workspaces.

. If you selected Workspace Admin, select one or more workspaces to associate with that user.

. Click *Associate User*.

.Result

The user should receive an email from NetApp Cloud Central titled "Account Association." The email includes the information needed to access Cloud Manager.

== Associating Workspace Admins with workspaces

You can associate Workspace Admins with additional workspaces at any time. Associating the user enables them to create and view the working environments in that workspace.

.Steps

. From the top of Cloud Manager, click the *Account* drop-down.
+

. Click *Manage Account Settings* next to the currently selected account.
+

. From the Users tab, click the action menu in the row that corresponds to the user.
+

. Click *Manage Workspaces*.

. Select one or more workspaces and click *Apply*.

.Result

The user can now access those workspaces from Cloud Manager, as long as the Connector was also associated with the workspaces.

== Associating Connectors with workspaces

You need to associate a Connector with workspaces so Workspace Admins can use those Connectors to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

If you only have Account Admins, then associating the Connector with workspaces isn't required. Account Admins have the ability to access all workspaces in Cloud Manager by default.

.Steps

. From the top of Cloud Manager, click the *Account* drop-down.
+
image:screenshot_account_settings_menu.gif[A screenshot that shows the Account Settings option in the top banner of Cloud Manager.]

. Click *Manage Account Settings* next to the currently selected account.
+
image:screenshot_manage_account_settings.gif[A screenshot that shows the Manage Account Settings option that's available from the Account drop-down.]

. Click *Connector*.

. Click *Manage Workspaces* for the Connector that you want to associate.

. Select one or more workspaces and click *Apply*.

.Result

Workspace Admins can now use those Connectors to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

== What's next?

Now that you've set up your account, you can manage it any time by removing users, managing workspaces, Connectors, and subscriptions. link:task_managing_cloud_central_accounts.html[Learn more].
