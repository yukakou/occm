Cloud Manager enables you to choose the AWS account in which you want to deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. You can deploy all of your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in the initial AWS account, or you can set up additional accounts.

== The initial AWS account

When you deploy Cloud Manager from NetApp Cloud Central, you need to use an AWS account that has permissions to launch the Cloud Manager instance. The required permissions are listed in the https://mysupport.netapp.com/info/web/ECMP11022837.html[NetApp Cloud Central policy for AWS^].

When Cloud Central launches the Cloud Manager instance in AWS, it creates an IAM role and an instance profile for the instance. It also attaches a policy that provides Cloud Manager with permissions to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP in that AWS account. link:reference_permissions.html#what-cloud-manager-does-with-aws-permissions[Review how Cloud Manager uses the permissions].

Cloud Manager selects this cloud provider account by default when you create a new working environment:

== Additional AWS accounts

If you want to launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP in different AWS accounts, then you can either link:task_adding_aws_accounts.html[provide AWS keys for an IAM user or the ARN of a role in a trusted account]. The following image shows two additional accounts, one providing permissions through an IAM role in a trusted account and another through the AWS keys of an IAM user:

image:diagram_permissions_multiple_aws.png["A conceptual image that shows two additional accounts. Each has an IAM policy, one is attached to IAM user and the other is attached to an IAM role."]

You would then link:task_adding_aws_accounts.html#adding-aws-accounts-to-cloud-manager[add the account credentials to Cloud Manager] by specifying the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role, or the AWS keys for the IAM user.

After you add another account, you can switch to it when creating a new working environment:

.What about Marketplace deployments and on-prem deployments?
****
The sections above describe the recommended deployment method from NetApp Cloud Central. You can also deploy Cloud Manager in AWS from the link:task_launching_aws_mktp.html[AWS Marketplace] and you can link:task_installing_linux.html[install Cloud Manager on-premises].

If you use the Marketplace, permissions are provided in the same way. You just need to manually create and set up the IAM role, and then provide permissions for any additional accounts.

For on-premises deployments, you can't set up an IAM role for the Cloud Manager system, but you can provide permissions just like you would for additional AWS accounts.
