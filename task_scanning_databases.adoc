== Reviewing prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Cloud Compliance.

=== Supported databases

Cloud Compliance can scan schemas from the following databases:

* MongoDB
* MySQL
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* SAP HANA
* SQL Server (MSSQL)

IMPORTANT: The statistics gathering feature *must be enabled* in the database.

=== Database requirements

Any database with connectivity to the Cloud Compliance instance can be scanned, regardless of where it is hosted. You just need the following information to connect to the database:

* IP Address or host name
* Port
* Service name (only for accessing Oracle databases)
* Credentials that allow read access to the schemas
+
When choosing a user name and password, it’s important to choose one that has full read permissions to all the schemas and tables you want to scan. We recommend that you create a dedicated user for the Cloud Compliance system with all the required permissions.

*Note:* For MongoDB, a read-only Admin role is required.

== Adding the database server

You must have link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[deployed an instance of Cloud Compliance in Cloud Manager already^].

Add the database server where the schemas reside.

. From the Working Environments Configuration page, click *Add Data Source* > *Add Database Server*.

. Enter the required information to identify the database server.
.. Select the database type.
.. Enter the port and the host name or IP address to connect to the database.
.. For Oracle databases, enter the Service name.
.. Enter the credentials so that Cloud Compliance can access the server.
.. Click *Add DB Server*.

The database is added to the list of working environments.

== Enabling and disabling compliance scans on database schemas

You can stop or start scanning schemas at any time.

. From the _Scan Configuration_ page, click the *Configuration* button for the database you want to configure.
+

.Result

Cloud Compliance starts scanning the database schemas that you enabled. If there are any errors, they’ll appear in the Status column, alongside the required action to fix the error.

== Removing a database from Cloud Compliance

If you no longer want to scan a certain database, you can delete it from the Cloud Compliance interface and stop all scans.

From the _Scan Configuration_ page, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button in the row for the database, and then click *Remove DB Server*.
