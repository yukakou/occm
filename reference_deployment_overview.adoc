Before you get started, you might want to better understand your options for deploying OnCommand Cloud Manager and ONTAP Cloud.

toc::[]

== Cloud Manager installation

Cloud Manager software is required to deploy and manage ONTAP Cloud systems. You can deploy Cloud Manager in any of the following locations:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* IBM Cloud
* In your own network

How you deploy Cloud Manager depends on which location you choose:

For Azure, NetApp Cloud Central unless you are deploying in the Azure Gov region or Azure Germany region. In those regions, you must download and install the software on Linux host. The same is true for IBM Cloud and your own network.]

Refer to the following for deploying Cloud Manager from NetApp Cloud Central:

* link:task_getting_started_azure.html[Getting started in Azure]

For all other scenarios, refer to the following:

* link:task_installing_azure_gov.html[Installing Cloud Manager in an Azure US Gov region]
* link:task_installing_azure_germany.html[Installing Cloud Manager in the Azure Germany region]
* link:task_installing_linux.html[Installing Cloud Manager on a Linux host]

== Cloud Manager setup

You might want to perform additional setup after you install Cloud Manager, such as adding additional AWS accounts, installing an HTTPS certificate, and more. For instructions, see link:task_setting_up_cloud_manager.html[Setting up Cloud Manager].

== ONTAP Cloud deployment

After you get Cloud Manager up and running, you can start deploying ONTAP Cloud systems in AWS and in Microsoft Azure.

link:task_getting_started_aws.html[Getting started in AWS] and link:task_getting_started_azure.html[Getting started in Azure] provide instructions for getting ONTAP Cloud up and running quickly. For additional help, see link:task_planning_your_config.html[Planning your configuration].
