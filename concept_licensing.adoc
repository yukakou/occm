Each ONTAP Cloud BYOL system must have a license installed with an active subscription. If an active license is not installed, the ONTAP Cloud system shuts itself down after 30 days. Cloud Manager simplifies the process by managing licenses for you and by notifying you before they expire.

=== License management for a new system

A tenant must be linked to a NetApp Support Site account so Cloud Manager can obtain licenses for ONTAP Cloud BYOL systems. If the credentials are not present, Cloud Manager prompts you to enter them when you create a new ONTAP Cloud BYOL working environment.

=== Why you should link a tenant to your NetApp Support Site account

Each time you launch an ONTAP Cloud BYOL system, Cloud Manager automatically downloads the license from NetApp and installs it on the ONTAP Cloud system.

If Cloud Manager cannot access the license file over the secure Internet connection, you can obtain the file yourself and then manually upload the file to Cloud Manager.

=== License expiration

Cloud Manager warns you 30 days before a license is due to expire and again when the license expires. The following image shows a 30-day expiration warning:

You can select the working environment to review the message.

If you do not renew the license in time, the ONTAP Cloud system shuts itself down. If you restart it, it shuts itself down again.

NOTE: ONTAP Cloud can also notify you through email, an SNMP traphost, or syslog server using EMS (Event Management System) event notifications. For instructions, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.exp-ems/home.html[ONTAP 9 EMS Configuration Express Guide^].

=== License renewal

When you renew a BYOL subscription by contacting a NetApp representative, Cloud Manager automatically obtains the new license from NetApp and installs it on the ONTAP Cloud system.

If Cloud Manager cannot access the license file over the secure Internet connection, you can obtain the file yourself and then manually upload the file to Cloud Manager.
