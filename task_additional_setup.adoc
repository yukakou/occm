== Installing an HTTPS certificate for secure access

By default, Cloud Manager uses a self-signed certificate for HTTPS access to the web console. You can install a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA), which provides better security protection than a self-signed certificate.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the task drop-down list, and then select *HTTPS Setup*.

. In the HTTPS Setup page, install a certificate by generating a certificate signing request (CSR) or by installing your own CA-signed certificate:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Option
| Description
| Generate a CSR
a|
.. Enter the host name or DNS of the Cloud Manager host (its Common Name), and then click *Generate CSR*.
+
Cloud Manager displays a certificate signing request.

.. Use the CSR to submit an SSL certificate request to a CA.
+
The certificate must use the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Base-64 encoded X.509 format.

.. Copy the content of the signed certificate, paste it in the Certificate field, and then click *Install*.

| Install your own CA-signed certificate
a|
.. Select *Install CA-signed certificate*.

.. Load both the certificate file and the private key and then click *Install*.
+
The certificate must use the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Base-64 encoded X.509 format.
|===

.Result

Cloud Manager now uses the CA-signed certificate to provide secure HTTPS access. The following image shows a Cloud Manager system that is configured for secure access:

== Adding users to Cloud Manager

If additional users need to use your Cloud Manager system, they must sign up for an account in the NetApp Cloud Data Services Portal. You can then add the users to Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. If the user does not yet have an account in the NetApp Cloud Data Services Portal, send them a link to your Cloud Manager system and have them sign up.
+
Wait until the user confirms that they have signed up for an account.

. In Cloud Manager, click the user icon and then click *Users*.
+
image:screenshot_user.gif[Screen shot: Shows the Users option selected in the task drop-down list.]

. Click *Add User*.

. Enter the email address associated with the user account, select a role, and click *Add*.

.After you finish

Inform the user that they can now log in to the Cloud Manager system.

== Linking tenants to a NetApp Support Site account

You should link a tenant to a NetApp Support Site account so Cloud Manager can manage licenses for BYOL systems, register pay-as-you-go instances for support, and upgrade ONTAP Cloud software.

.Steps

. Click *Tenants*.

. Select the tenant that you want to link to a NetApp Support Site account.

. Click *Change NSS account*.

. Enter the user name and password for a NetApp customer-level account (not a guest or temp account) and click *Save*.

.Result

Cloud Manager registers all existing and future ONTAP Cloud systems in the tenant with NetApp support.

== Setting up ONTAP Cloud encryption

The Cloud Manager Admin user must set up Cloud Manager before other users can enable ONTAP Cloud encryption on new ONTAP Cloud systems in AWS.

.Steps

. <<Setting up Cloud Manager as an intermediate CA,Set up Cloud Manager as an intermediate CA>>.

. <<Adding key managers and CA certificates to Cloud Manager,Add key managers and their CA certificates to Cloud Manager>>.

=== Key manager requirements

You need a supported key management infrastructure to use ONTAP Cloud encryption.

==== Supported key managers

An external key manager is a system in your network or in AWS that securely stores authentication keys and provides them upon demand to ONTAP Cloud systems using secure TLS connections. The following key managers are supported:

* SafeNet Virtual KeySecure k150v
* SafeNet KeySecure k460
* Vormetric Data Security Manager

See the http://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] for supported software versions.

Each ONTAP Cloud system supports up to four key managers. You should use multiple key managers in a clustered configuration for redundancy.

==== Vormetric configuration requirements

See https://kb.netapp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1029882[NetApp KB article 000033069^].

NOTE: The Encryption Setup page in Cloud Manager pertains to SafeNet key managers only. You must refer to the KB article to set up ONTAP Cloud with Vormetric key managers. The rest of this section describes setup for SafeNet key managers.

==== SafeNet configuration requirements

Each SafeNet key manager must have several certificates, a KMIP server, and a network connection to ONTAP Cloud systems. The key manager must also meet specific requirements if using client certificate authentication. Note that Cloud Manager does not communicate with key managers, so a network connection between Cloud Manager and key managers is not required.

A description of the key manager requirements follows:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Requirement
| Description
| Key managers must have a server certificate |	Key managers need a server certificate to authenticate with ONTAP Cloud systems. The SSL certificate must use the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Base-64 encoded X.509 format. You select this server certificate when you configure the KMIP server on the key manager.

If you plan to use two to four key managers with an ONTAP Cloud system, the same certificate authority (CA) must sign the server certificate for each key manager.

| Key managers must trust the signing CA |	The CA that signed the server certificate must be known and trusted by the key manager.
Key managers must have a KMIP server 	Each key manager must have a KMIP server that uses SSL and a specific port. The default and recommended port for ONTAP Cloud is 5696. If needed, you can change this port when you set up Cloud Manager.

| Key managers must have a network connection to ONTAP Cloud systems |	If the key managers are in AWS, they must have a connection to the subnet in which ONTAP Cloud instances are running. If the key managers are in your network, a VPN connection to the VPC provides the required connection.

Firewall settings must allow communication through the KMIP port.

| Key managers must trust the Cloud Manager CA and its root CA, if using client certificate authentication |	When you set up Cloud Manager, you configure it to act as an intermediate CA so it can sign ONTAP Cloud client certificates. If a KMIP server requires client certificate authentication, then the Cloud Manager intermediate CA must be known and trusted by key managers.

The root CA that signed the Cloud Manager certificate must also be known and trusted by the key manager.

| Key managers must check a compatible user name field, if using client certificate authentication |	If the key manager's KMIP server checks for a user name in client certificates, it must use a field compatible with ONTAP Cloud client certificates. Cloud Manager can create ONTAP Cloud client certificates that include a user name in the CN (Common Name), E (Email address), and OU (Organizational Unit) fields.

| KMIP Cryptographic Usage Mask must be set to no a|	If you use SafeNet OS v8.6, you must do the following:

. Connect to the CLI using the admin user

. Enter the following commands:
+
*config*
*no kmip cryptographicusagemask*

. Restart the NAE Server from the user interface
|===

The following graphic depicts these requirements:

image:diagram_encryption_reqs.png[This illustration shows the requirements for key managers: a KMIP server, a server certificate, a CA certificate, the Cloud Manager certificate, and a VPN or subnet route to ONTAP Cloud.^]

Notes:

. The Cloud Manager intermediate CA and its root CA must be trusted only if the KMIP server requires client certificate authentication.

. The same CA must have signed the server certificate for both key managers. This CA is called the key manager CA.

After you meet these requirements, you must set up Cloud Manager so users can enable ONTAP Cloud encryption.

=== Setting up Cloud Manager as an intermediate CA

Cloud Manager must be an intermediate certificate authority (CA) because it needs to create client certificates for ONTAP Cloud. You set up Cloud Manager to be an intermediate CA by generating a certificate signing request (CSR), getting the CSR signed by a root CA, and then installing the certificate in Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Manager console, click the task drop-down list, and then select *Encryption Setup*.

. In the Intermediate CA tab, click *Generate CSR*.
+
Cloud Manager displays a certificate signing request.

. Use the CSR to submit a certificate request to a CA.
+
The intermediate CA certificate must use the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Base-64 encoded X.509 format.

. Copy the content of the signed certificate and paste it in the Cloud Manager certificate field.

. Click *Install Cloud Manager Certificate*.

.Result

Cloud Manager is now an intermediate CA—it can sign client certificates for ONTAP Cloud systems. The following image shows a Cloud Manager system that is configured to be an intermediate CA:

image:screenshot_intermediate_ca.gif[Screen shot: Shows the Cloud Manager certificate in the Intermediate CA tab, which appears after Cloud Manager is configured to be an intermediate CA]

.After you finish

If a KMIP server requires client certificate authentication, add the Cloud Manager intermediate CA and its root CA to the key manager's list of trusted CAs. This step is necessary because the key manager must verify that ONTAP Cloud client certificates were signed by a trusted CA.

=== Adding key managers and CA certificates to Cloud Manager

Cloud Manager needs information about your key managers and CA certificates so users can select them for use with ONTAP Cloud systems.

.Steps

. In the Encryption Setup page, click *Key Manager*.

. If your key managers use a KMIP port other than 5696, change the port and then click Save.
+
Cloud Manager configures ONTAP Cloud systems to connect to key managers using this port.

. In the Key Managers table, click *Add*.
+
In the Add Key Manager dialog box, enter details about the key manager, and then click *Add*:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Field
| Action
| Key Manager Name |	Enter a unique name to distinguish the key manager.
| IP Address |	Enter the IP address of the key manager.
| User Name for Client Certificate Authentication a|	If the key manager is enabled for client certificate authentication by having the key manager verify a user name from client certificates, specify the field and user name:

* Select the field in which the key manager should look for a user name.
* Enter a user name that is defined in the key manager.

Cloud Manager generates ONTAP Cloud client certificates with the value defined in the user name field.
|===

. In the Key Managers' CA Certificates table, click *Add*.

. Paste the certificate of the certificate authority (CA) that signed the key manager's server certificate and then click *Add*.

. Repeat the steps for any additional key managers and their CA certificates.

.Result

Cloud Manager is now set up to create ONTAP Cloud systems with encryption enabled.
