Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Cloud Compliance.

=== OneDrive requirements

You must have the Admin login credentials for the OneDrive for Business account that provides read access to all user files.

You will need a line-separated list of the email addresses for all the users whose OneDrive folders you want to scan.

== Adding OneDrive users to compliance scans

You can add individual OneDrive users, or all of your OneDrive users, so that their files will be scanned by Cloud Compliance.

A confirmation dialog displays the number of users who were added.

If the dialog lists any users who could not be added, capture this information so that you can resolve the issue. In some cases you can re-add the user with a corrected email address.

.Result

Cloud Compliance starts scanning the files for the users you added, and the results are displayed in the Dashboard and in other locations.

== Removing OneDrive users from compliance scans

If users leave the company or if their email address changes, you can remove individual OneDrive users from having their files scanned at any time. Just click *Remove OneDrive User* from the Configuration page.
