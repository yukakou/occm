Complete a few steps to get started backing up data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Azure Blob storage.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Verify support for your configuration

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* You're running Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 or later in Azure.
* You have subscribed to the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.cloud-manager?tab=Overview[Cloud Manager Marketplace Backup offering^], or you have purchased link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[and activated^] a Backup to Cloud BYOL license from NetApp.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Enable Backup to Cloud on your new or existing system

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* New systems: Backup to Cloud is enabled by default in the working environment wizard. Be sure to keep the option enabled.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] If needed, modify the backup policy

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. Change to weekly or monthly backups, or select one of the system-defined policies that provide more options. You can also change the number of backup copies to retain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
On existing systems, you can pick your own resource group when enabling Backup to Cloud. If you enable Backup to Cloud when Cloud Volumes ONTAP is initially deployed, Cloud Manager creates the resource group for you and you cannot change it.

Identify which volumes you want to back up in the Select Volumes page.

==== image:number5.png[Number 5] Restore your data, as needed
