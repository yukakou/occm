Respond to a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) by searching for a subject's full name or known identifier (such as an email address) and then downloading a report. The report is designed to aid in your organization's requirement to comply with GDPR or similar data privacy laws.

NOTE: NetApp can't guarantee 100% accuracy of the personal data and sensitive personal data that Cloud Compliance identifies. You should always validate the information by reviewing the data.

== What is a Data Subject Access Request?

Privacy regulations such as the European GDPR grant data subjects (such as customers or employees) the right to access their personal data. When a data subject requests this information, this is known as a DSAR (data subject access request). Organizations are required to respond to these requests "without undue delay," and at the latest within one month of receipt.

== How can Cloud Compliance help you respond to a DSAR?

When you perform a data subject search, Cloud Compliance finds all of the files that has that person's name or identifier in it. Cloud Compliance checks the latest pre-indexed data for the name or identifier. It doesn't initiate a new scan.

After the search is complete, you can then download the list of files or a Data Subject Access Request report. The report aggregates insights from the data and puts it into legal terms that you can send back to the person.

== Searching for data subjects and downloading reports

Search for the data subject's full name or known identifier and then download a file list report or DSAR report. You can search by link:task_controlling_private_data.html#types-of-personal-data[any personal information type].

NOTE: Only English is supported when searching for the names of data subjects. Support for more languages will be added later.

. Choose one of the available options:
* *Download File List Report*: A list of the files that contain information on the data subject.
+
NOTE: If there are more than 10,000 results, only the top 10,000 appear in the report (support for more will be added later).

* *Download DSAR Report*: A formal response to the access request that you can send to the data subject. This report contains automatically-generated information based on data that Cloud Compliance found on the data subject and is designed to be used as a template. You should complete the form and review it internally before sending it to the data subject.
