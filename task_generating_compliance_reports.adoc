Cloud Compliance provides reports that you can use to better understand the status of your organization's data privacy program.

By default, the Cloud Compliance dashboard displays compliance data for all working environments. If you want to view reports that contain data for only some of the working environments, <<Selecting the working environments for reports,select those working environments>>.

NOTE: NetApp can't guarantee 100% accuracy of the personal data and sensitive personal data that Cloud Compliance identifies. You should always validate the information by reviewing the data.

== Privacy Risk Assessment Report

The Privacy Risk Assessment Report provides an overview of your organization’s privacy risk status, as required by privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. The report includes the following information:

Compliance status:: A <<Severity score,severity score>> and the distribution of data, whether it's non-sensitive, personal, or sensitive personal.

Assessment overview:: A breakdown of the types of personal data found, as well as the categories of data.

Data subjects in this assessment:: The number of people, by location, for which national identifiers were found.

Cloud Compliance generates a PDF report that you can review and send to other groups as needed.

=== Severity score

Cloud Compliance calculates the severity score for the Privacy Risk Assessment Report on the basis of three variables:

* The percentage of personal data out of all data.
* The percentage of sensitive personal data out of all data.
* The percentage of files that include data subjects, determined by national identifiers such as national IDs, Social Security numbers, and tax ID numbers.

The logic used to determine the score is as follows:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="27,73"]
|===

| Severity score
| Logic

| 0 | All three variables are exactly 0%
| 1 |	One of the variables are larger than 0%
| 2 |	One of the variables are larger than 3%
| 3 |	Two of the variables are larger than 3%
| 4 |	Three of the variables are larger than 3%
| 5 |	One of the variables are larger than 6%
| 6 |	Two of the variables are larger than 6%
| 7 |	Three of the variables are larger than 6%
| 8 |	One of the variables are larger than 15%
| 9 |	Two of the variables are larger than 15%
| 10 | Three of the variables are larger than 15%

== PCI DSS Report

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Report can help you identify the distribution of credit card information across your files. The report includes the following information:

Overview:: How many files contain credit card information and in which working environments.

Encryption:: The percentage of files containing credit card information that are on encrypted or unencrypted working environments. This information is specific to Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

Ransomware Protection:: The percentage of files containing credit card information that are on working environments that do or don't have ransomware protection enabled. This information is specific to Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

Retention:: The timeframe in which the files were last modified. This is helpful because you shouldn't keep credit card information for longer than you need to process it.

Distribution of Credit Card Information:: The working environments where the credit card information was found and whether encryption and ransomware protection are enabled.

=== Generating the PCI DSS Report
