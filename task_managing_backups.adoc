You can manage backups for Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems by changing the backup schedule, enabling/disabling volume backups, deleting backups, and more.

== Changing the schedule and backup retention

The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. You can change to weekly or monthly backups and you can change the number of backup copies to retain. You can also select one of the system-defined policies that provide scheduled backups for 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years.

TIP: Changing the backup policy affects only new volumes created after you change the schedule. It doesn't affect the schedule for any existing volumes.

.Steps

. Select the working environment.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More icon] and select *Backup Settings*.

== Starting and stopping backups of volumes

You can stop backing up a volume if you do not need backup copies of that volume and you do not want to pay for the cost to store the backups. You can also add a new volume to the backup list if it is not currently being backed up.

.Steps

. Select the working environment.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More icon] and select *Backup Settings*.
+

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment and select *Manage Volumes*.

. Select the checkbox for volumes that you want to start backing up, and deselect the checkbox for volumes that you want to stop backing up.

*Note:* When stopping a volume from being backed up you’ll continue to be charged by your cloud provider for object storage costs for the capacity that the backups use unless you <<Deleting backups,delete the backups>>.

== Deleting backups

Cloud Backup enables you to delete _all_ backups of a specific volume. You can't delete _individual_ backups. You might do this if you no longer need the backups or if you deleted the source volume and want to remove all backups.

Note that deleting all backups also disables any further backups of this volume. If you later want to start creating backups of that volume, you can re-enable backups <<Starting and stopping backups of volumes,as described here>>.

IMPORTANT: If you plan to delete a Cloud Volumes ONTAP or on-premises ONTAP system that has backups, you must delete the backups *before* deleting the system.  Cloud Backup doesn’t automatically delete backups when you delete a system, and there is no current support in the UI to delete the backups after the system has been deleted.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Backup*.

. From the volume list, find the volume and click *View Backup List*.

. Click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] and select *Delete All Backups*.

. In the confirmation dialog box, click *Delete*.

== Disabling Cloud Backup

Disabling Cloud Backup for a working environment disables backups of each volume on the system, and it also disables the ability to restore a volume. Any existing backups will not be deleted.

Note that you'll continue to be charged by your cloud provider for object storage costs for the capacity that your backups use unless you delete the backups.

.Steps

. Select the working environment.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More icon] and select *Backup Settings*.

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment and select *Deactivate Cloud Backup*.
