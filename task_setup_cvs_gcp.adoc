Create a Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud working environment in Cloud Manager to create and manage volumes and snapshots.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or go to the next section for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Enable the Cloud Volumes Service API

[role="quick-margin-para"]
From Google, enable the Cloud Volumes Service for GCP API so that Cloud Manager can manage the subscription.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Create a GCP service account

[role="quick-margin-para"]
From Google, create a GCP service account and role so that Cloud Manager can access your Cloud Volumes Service for GCP account.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Create a Cloud Volumes Service for GCP working environment

[role="quick-margin-para"]
In Cloud Manager, click *Add Working Environment* > *Google Cloud* > *Cloud Volumes Service* and then provide details about the service account and Google Cloud project.

== Enable the Cloud Volumes Service API

In Google Cloud Shell, run the following command to enable the Cloud Volumes Service API:

    `gcloud --project=<my-cvs-project> services enable cloudvolumesgcp-api.netapp.com`

== Give Cloud Manager access to the Cloud Volumes Service for GCP account

You must create a service account and role that Cloud Manager can use to access your Google account and cloud volumes.

=== Create a service account and service access key

Create a service account and access key pair that is used to authenticate to Google.

. In the Google Cloud Console, go to the *Service Accounts* page.

. Click *Select a project*, choose your project, and click *Open*.

. Click *Create Service Account*.

. Enter a service account name (friendly display name), an optional description, select the _admin_ role, and then click *Save*.

. In the row for the new service account, click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button], and then click *Create key*.

. Select a *Key type* and click *Create*.

By clicking *Create* your new public/private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine. It serves as the only copy of the private key. Store this file securely because it can be used to authenticate as your service account.

For detailed steps, see the Google Cloud topics link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts[Creating and managing service accounts^] and link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys[Creating and managing service account keys^].

=== Add an IAM role for the service account

Add an IAM role for the service account.

. In the Google Cloud Console, in your project, go to the *IAM* page and click *Add*.

. Enter the service account and a single email address (required).

. Select the _compute.viewer_ role.

. Click *Save*.

For detailed steps, see the Google Cloud topics link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access[Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources^]

== Create a Cloud Volumes Service for GCP working environment

Set up a Cloud Volumes Service for GCP working environment in Cloud Manager so you can start creating volumes.

Regardless of whether you have already created volumes from the Google Cloud Console, or if you just signed up for Cloud Volumes Service for GCP and have no volumes yet, the first step is to create a working environment for the volumes based on your GCP subscription.

If cloud volumes already exist for this subscription, then the volumes will appear in the new working environment. If you haven't added any cloud volumes yet for the GCP subscription, then you do that after you create the new working environment.

TIP: If you have subscriptions and volumes in multiple GCP regions, you need to perform this task for each region.

.Before you begin

You must have the following information available when adding a subscription in each region:

* Service account credentials.

* Project name.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, add a new Working Environment, select the location *Google Cloud*, and click *Continue*.

. Select *Cloud Volumes Service* and click *Continue*.

. Provide information about your Cloud Volumes Service subscription:

.. Enter the Working Environment Name you want to use.
.. Copy/paste the service account credentials that you downloaded in the previous steps.
.. Select the name of your Google Cloud project.
.. Click *Add*.

.Result

Cloud Manager displays your Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud working environment.

If cloud volumes already exist for this subscription, then the volumes appear in the new working environment, as shown in the screenshot. You can add additional cloud volumes from Cloud Manager.

If no cloud volumes exist for this subscription, create them now.
