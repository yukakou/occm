You must set up your networking so that Cloud Manager can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in AWS or in Microsoft Azure. The most important step is ensuring outbound internet access to various endpoints.

TIP: If your network uses a proxy server for all communication to the internet, Cloud Manager prompts you to specify the proxy during setup. You can also specify the proxy server from the Settings page. Refer to link:task_configuring_proxy.html[Configuring Cloud Manager to use a proxy server].

== Connection to target networks

Cloud Manager requires a network connection to the AWS VPCs and Azure VNets in which you want to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

For example, if you install Cloud Manager in your corporate network, then you must set up a VPN connection to the AWS VPC or Azure VNet in which you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Outbound internet access

Cloud Manager requires outbound internet access to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Outbound internet access is also required when accessing Cloud Manager from your web browser and when running the Cloud Manager installer on a Linux host.

The following sections identify the specific endpoints.

Outbound internet access to manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS::
Cloud Manager requires outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints when deploying and managing Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS:

Outbound internet access from your web browser::
Users must access Cloud Manager from a web browser. The machine running the web browser must have connections to the following endpoints:
+
[cols="43,57",options="header"]
|===
| Endpoints
| Purpose
|
The Cloud Manager host

a| You must enter the host's IP address from a web browser to load the Cloud Manager console.

If you deploy Cloud Manager in AWS, the easiest way to provide access is by allocating a public IP address. However, if you want to use a private IP address instead, users can access the console through either of the following:

** A jump host in the VPC that has a connection to Cloud Manager
** A host in your network that has a VPN connection to the private IP address

|
\https://auth0.com
\https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com
\https://services.cloud.netapp.com

| Your web browser connects to these endpoints for centralized user authentication through NetApp Cloud Central.

|===

Outbound internet access to install Cloud Manager on a Linux host::
The Cloud Manager installer must access the following URLs during the installation process:

* \http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
* \https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
* \https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip

== Ports and security groups

* If you deploy Cloud Manager from Cloud Central or from the marketplace images, refer to the following:

** link:reference_security_groups_azure.html#rules-for-cloud-manager[Security group rules for Cloud Manager in Azure]

* If you install Cloud Manager on an existing Linux host, see link:reference_cloud_mgr_reqs.html[Cloud Manager host requirements].
