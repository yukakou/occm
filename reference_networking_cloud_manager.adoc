[.lead]
Set up your networking so the Connector can manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. The most important step is ensuring outbound internet access to various endpoints.

TIP: If your network uses a proxy server for all communication to the internet, you can specify the proxy server from the Settings page. Refer to link:task_configuring_proxy.html[Configuring the Connector to use a proxy server].

== Connection to target networks

A Connector requires a network connection to the type of working environment that you’re creating and the services that you’re planning to enable.

For example, if you install a Connector in your corporate network, then you must set up a VPN connection to the VPC or VNet in which you launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Outbound internet access

The Connector requires outbound internet access to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. Outbound internet access is also required if you want to manually install the Connector on a Linux host or access the local UI running on the Connector.

The following sections identify the specific endpoints.

=== Endpoints to manage resources in AWS

A Connector contacts the following endpoints when managing resources in AWS:

=== Endpoints to install the Connector on a Linux host

You have the option to manually install the Connector software on your own Linux host. If you do, the installer for the Connector must access the following URLs during the installation process:

* \http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
* \https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
* \https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip

The host might try to update operating system packages during installation. The host can contact different mirroring sites for these OS packages.

=== Endpoints accessed from your web browser when using the local UI

While you should perform almost all tasks from the SaaS user interface, a local user interface is still available on the Connector. The machine running the web browser must have connections to the following endpoints:

[cols="43,57",options="header"]
|===
| Endpoints
| Purpose
|
The Connector host

a| You must enter the host's IP address from a web browser to load the Cloud Manager console.

Depending on your connectivity to your cloud provider, you can use the private IP or a public IP assigned to the host:

- A private IP works if you have a VPN and direct connect access to your virtual network
- A public IP works in any networking scenario

In any case, you should secure network access by ensuring that security group rules allow access from only authorized IPs or subnets.

|
\https://auth0.com
\https://cdn.auth0.com
\https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com
\https://services.cloud.netapp.com

| Your web browser connects to these endpoints for centralized user authentication through NetApp Cloud Central.

== Ports and security groups

There's no incoming traffic to the Connector, unless you initiate it. HTTP and HTTPS provide access to the link:concept_connectors.html#the-local-user-interface[local UI], which you'll use in rare circumstances. SSH is only needed if you need to connect to the host for troubleshooting.

=== Rules for the Connector in AWS

The security group for the Connector requires both inbound and outbound rules.

==== Inbound rules

[cols="10,10,80",width=100%,options="header"]
|===

| Protocol
