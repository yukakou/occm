When you create your first Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, Cloud Manager prompts you to create a Connector. A Connector enables Cloud Manager to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. You also have the option to create a new Connector at any time.

== Creating a Connector in AWS

Cloud Manager enables you to create a Connector in AWS directly from its user interface. You also have the option to link:task_launching_aws_mktp.html[create the Connector from the AWS Marketplace], or link:task_installing_linux.html[download the software and install it on your own host].

.What you'll need

. An AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user who has the required permissions.
. A VPC, subnet, and keypair in your AWS region of choice.

.Steps
