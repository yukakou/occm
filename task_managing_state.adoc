== Scheduling automatic shutdowns of Cloud Volumes ONTAP

You might want to shut down Cloud Volumes ONTAP during specific time intervals to lower your compute costs. Rather than do this manually, you can configure Cloud Manager to automatically shut down and then restart systems at specific times.

.About this task

This task schedules automatic shutdowns of both nodes in an HA pair.

.Steps

. From the working environment, click the clock icon:
+

. Specify the shutdown schedule:

.. Choose whether you want to shut down the system every day, every weekday, every weekend, or any combination of the three options.

.. Specify when you want to turn off the system and for how long you want it turned off.
+
*Example*
+
The following image shows a schedule that instructs Cloud Manager to shut down the system every Saturday at 12:00 a.m. for 48 hours. Cloud Manager restarts the system every Monday at 12:00 a.m.

. Click *Save*.

.Result

Cloud Manager saves the schedule. The clock icon changes to indicate that a schedule is set: image:screenshot_shutdown_icon_scheduled.gif[Screen shot: Shows the automatic shutdown icon after a schedule is defined.]

== Stopping Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Stopping Cloud Volumes ONTAP saves you from accruing compute costs and creates snapshots of the root and boot disks, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.

.About this task

When you stop an HA pair, Cloud Manager shuts down both nodes.

.Steps

. From the working environment, click the *Turn off* icon.
+

. Keep the option to create snapshots enabled because the snapshots can enable system recovery.

. Click *Turn Off*.
+
It can take up to a few minutes to stop the system. You can restart systems at a later time from the working environment page.
