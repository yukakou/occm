== Managing existing volumes

You can manage existing volumes as your storage needs change. You can view, edit, clone, restore, and delete volumes.

.Steps

. On the Working Environments page, double-click the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment on which you want to manage volumes.

. Manage your volumes:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===

| Task
| Action

| View information about a volume | Select a volume, and then click *Info*.

| Edit a volume (read-write volumes only)
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Edit*.
.. Modify the volume's Snapshot policy, NFS access control list, or share permissions, and then click *Update*.

| Clone a volume
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Clone*.
.. Modify the clone name as needed, and then click *Clone*.

This process creates a FlexClone volume. A FlexClone volume is a writable, point-in-time copy that is space-efficient because it uses a small amount of space for metadata, and then only consumes additional space as data is changed or added.

To learn more about FlexClone volumes, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-vsmg/home.html[ONTAP 9 Logical Storage Management Guide^].

| Restore data from a Snapshot copy to a new volume
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Restore from Snapshot copy*.
.. Select a Snapshot copy, enter a name for the new volume, and then click *Restore*.

| Create a Snapshot copy on demand
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Create a Snapshot copy*.
.. Change the name, if needed, and then click *Create*.

| Get the NFS mount command
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Mount Command*.
.. Click *Copy*.

| Change the underlying disk type
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Change Disk Type & Tiering Policy*.
.. Select the disk type, and then click *Change*.

NOTE: Cloud Manager moves the volume to an existing aggregate that uses the selected disk type or it creates a new aggregate for the volume.

| Change the tiering policy
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Change Disk Type & Tiering Policy*.
.. Click *Edit Policy*.
.. Select a different policy and click *Change*.

NOTE: Cloud Manager moves the volume to an existing aggregate that uses the selected disk type with tiering, or it creates a new aggregate for the volume.

| Enable or disable sync to S3 for a volume
a| Select a volume and then click *Sync to S3* or *Delete Sync Relationship*.

NOTE: The sync to S3 feature must be enabled before you can use these options. For instructions, see link:task_syncing_s3.html[Syncing data to AWS S3]

| Delete a volume
a|
.. Select a volume, and then click *Delete*.
.. Click *Delete* again to confirm.

== Managing existing aggregates

If you want to manage existing aggregates yourself, you can add disks to aggregates, view information about aggregates, and delete them.

.Before you begin

If you want to delete an aggregate, you must have first deleted the volumes in the aggregate.

.About this task

If an aggregate is running out of space, you can move volumes to another aggregate by using OnCommand System Manager.

.Steps

. On the Working Environments page, double-click the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment on which you want to manage aggregates.

. Click the menu icon and then click *Advanced > Advanced allocation*.
. Manage your aggregates:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===

| Task
| Action

| View information about an aggregate | Select an aggregate and click *Info*.

| Create a volume on a specific aggregate |	Select an aggregate and click *Create volume*.

| Add disks to an aggregate
a|
.. Select an aggregate and click *Add AWS disks* or *Add Azure disks*.
.. Select the number of disks that you want to add and click *Add*.

| Delete an aggregate
a|
.. Select an aggregate that does not contain any volumes and click *Delete*.
.. Click *Delete* again to confirm.

|===

== Modifying the CIFS server

If you change your DNS servers or Active Directory domain, you need to modify the CIFS server in Cloud Volumes ONTAP so that it can continue to serve storage to clients.

.Steps

. From the working environment, click the menu icon and then click *Advanced > CIFS setup*.

. Specify settings for the CIFS server:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===

| Task
| Action

| DNS Primary and Secondary IP Address | The IP addresses of the DNS servers that provide name resolution for the CIFS server.

The listed DNS servers must contain the service location records (SRV) needed to locate the Active Directory LDAP servers and domain controllers for the domain that the CIFS server will join.

| Active Directory Domain to join |	The FQDN of the Active Directory (AD) domain that you want the CIFS server to join.

| Credentials authorized to join the domain |	The name and password of a Windows account with sufficient privileges to add computers to the specified Organizational Unit (OU) within the AD domain.

| CIFS server NetBIOS name | 	A CIFS server name that is unique in the AD domain.

| Organizational Unit | The organizational unit within the AD domain to associate with the CIFS server. The default is CN=Computers.

| DNS Domain | The DNS domain for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM). In most cases, the domain is the same as the AD domain.

|===

. Click *Save*.

.Result

Cloud Volumes ONTAP updates the CIFS server with the changes.

== Moving a volume to avoid capacity issues

Cloud Manager might display an Action Required message that says moving a volume is necessary to avoid capacity issues, but that it cannot provide recommendations to correct the issue. If this happens, you need to identify how to correct the issue and then move one or more volumes.

.Steps

. <<Identifying how to correct capacity issues,Identify how to correct the issue>>.

. Based on your analysis, move volumes to avoid capacity issues:

* <<Moving volumes to another system to avoid capacity issues,Move volumes to another system>>.

* <<Moving volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues,Move volumes to another aggregate on the same system>>.

=== Identifying how to correct capacity issues

If Cloud Manager cannot provide recommendations for moving a volume to avoid capacity issues, you must identify the volumes that you need to move and whether you should move them to another aggregate on the same system or to another system.

.Steps

. View the advanced information in the Action Required message to identify the aggregate that has reached its capacity limit.
+
For example, the advanced information should say something similar to the following: Aggregate aggr1 has reached its capacity limit.

. Identify one or more volumes to move out of the aggregate:

.. In the working environment, click the menu icon, and then click *Advanced > Advanced allocation*.

.. Select the aggregate, and then click *Info*.

.. Expand the list of volumes.
+
image:screenshot_aggr_volumes.gif[Screen shot: Shows the list of volumes in an aggregate in the aggregate information dialog box.]

.. Review the size of each volume and choose one or more volumes to move out of the aggregate.
+
You should choose volumes that are large enough to free space in the aggregate so that you avoid additional capacity issues in the future.

. If the system has not reached the disk limit, you should move the volumes to an existing aggregate or a new aggregate on the same system.
+
For details, see link:task_managing_storage.html#moving-volumes-to-another-aggregate-to-avoid-capacity-issues[Moving volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues].

. If the system has reached the disk limit, do any of the following:

.. Delete any unused volumes.

.. Rearrange volumes to free space on an aggregate.
+
For details, see link:task_managing_storage.html#moving-volumes-to-another-aggregate-to-avoid-capacity-issues[Moving volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues].

.. Move two or more volumes to another system that has space.
+
For details, see link:task_managing_storage.html#moving-volumes-to-another-system-to-avoid-capacity-issues[Moving volumes to another system to avoid capacity issues].

=== Moving volumes to another system to avoid capacity issues

You can move one or more volumes to another Cloud Volumes ONTAP system to avoid capacity issues. You might need to do this if the system reached its disk limit.

.About this task

You can follow the steps in this task to correct the following Action Required message:

 Moving a volume is necessary to avoid capacity issues; however, Cloud Manager cannot perform this action for you because the system has reached the disk limit.

.Steps

. Identify a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that has available capacity, or deploy a new system.

. Drag and drop the source working environment on the target working environment to perform a one-time data replication of the volume.
+
For details, see link:task_replicating_data.html#replicating-data-between-systems[Replicating data between systems].

. Go to the Replication Status page, and then break the SnapMirror relationship to convert the replicated volume from a data protection volume to a read/write volume.
+
For details, see link:task_replicating_data.html#managing-data-replication-schedules-and-relationships[Managing data replication schedules and relationships].

. Configure the volume for data access.
+
For information about configuring a destination volume for data access, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.exp-sm-ic-fr/home.html[ONTAP 9 Volume Disaster Recovery Express Guide^].

. Delete the original volume.
+
For details, see link:task_managing_storage.html#managing-existing-volumes[Managing existing volumes].

=== Moving volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues

You can move one or more volumes to another aggregate to avoid capacity issues.

.About this task

You can follow the steps in this task to correct the following Action Required message:

 Moving two or more volumes is necessary to avoid capacity issues; however, Cloud Manager cannot perform this action for you.

.Steps

. Verify whether an existing aggregate has available capacity for the volumes that you need to move:

.. In the working environment, click the menu icon, and then click *Advanced > Advanced allocation*.

.. Select each aggregate, click *Info*, and then view the available capacity (aggregate capacity minus used aggregate capacity).
+
image:screenshot_aggr_capacity.gif[Screen shot: Shows the total aggregate capacity and used aggregate capacity available in the aggregate information dialog box.]

. If needed, add disks to an existing aggregate:

.. Select the aggregate, and then click *Add disks*.

.. Select the number of disks to add, and then click *Add*.

. If no aggregates have available capacity, create a new aggregate.
+
For details, see link:task_provisioning_storage.html#creating-aggregates[Creating aggregates].

. Use System Manager or the CLI to move the volumes to the aggregate.

. In most situations, you can use System Manager to move volumes.
