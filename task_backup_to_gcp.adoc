Complete a few steps to get started backing up data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Google Cloud Storage.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Verify support for your configuration

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* You're running Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7P5 or later in GCP.
* You have a valid GCP subscription for the storage space where your backups will be located.
* You have a service account in your Google Cloud Project that has the predefined Storage Admin role.
* You have subscribed to the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager?supportedpurview=project&rif_reserved[Cloud Manager Marketplace Backup offering^], or you have purchased link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[and activated^] a Backup to Cloud BYOL license from NetApp.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Enable Backup to Cloud on your new or existing system

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* New systems: Backup to Cloud can be enabled when you complete the new working environment wizard.

* Existing systems: Select the working environment and click *Activate* next to the Backup to Cloud service in the right-panel, and then follow the setup wizard.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Define the backup policy

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. Change to weekly or monthly backups, or select one of the system-defined policies that provide more options.

[role="quick-margin-para"]

==== image:number5.png[Number 5] Select the volumes that you want to back up

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Identify which volumes you want to back up in the Select Volumes page.

==== image:number6.png[Number 6] Restore your data, as needed

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Restore a backup to a new volume. You can restore data to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Google. A Service Account is required on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system where you are performing the restore.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
See link:task_restore_backups.html[Restoring volume data from backup files^] for details.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you start backing up volumes to Google Cloud storage.

Supported ONTAP versions::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7P5 and later.

Supported GCP regions::
Backup to Cloud is supported in all GCP regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^].

License requirements::
For Backup to Cloud PAYGO licensing, a subscription through the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager?supportedpurview=project&rif_reserved[GCP Marketplace] is required before you enable Backup to Cloud. Billing for Backup to Cloud is done through this subscription. link:task_deploying_gcp.html[You can subscribe from the Details & Credentials page of the working environment wizard^].
+
For Backup to Cloud BYOL licensing, you need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. See link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[Adding and updating your Backup BYOL license^].
+
And you need to have a Google subscription for the storage space where your backups will be located.

GCP Service Account::
You need to have a service account in your Google Cloud Project that has the predefined Storage Admin role. link:task_creating_gcp_service_account.html[Learn how to create a service account].

== Enabling Backup to Cloud on a new system

Backup to Cloud can be enabled when you complete the working environment wizard to create a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

You must have a Service Account already configured. If you don’t select a service account when you create the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, then you’ll need to turn off the system and add the service account to Cloud Volumes ONTAP from the GCP console.

See link:task_deploying_gcp.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP] for requirements and details for creating your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.Steps

. On the Working Environments page, click *Add Working Environment* and follow the prompts.

. *Choose a Location*: Select *Google Cloud Platform*.

. *Choose Type*: Select *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* (either single-node or high-availability).

. *Details & Credentials*: Enter the following information:
.. Click *Edit Project* and select a new project if the one you want to use is different than the default Project (where Cloud Manager resides).
.. Specify the cluster name.
.. Enable the *Service Account* switch and select the Service Account that has the predefined Storage Admin role. This is required to enable backups and tiering.
.. Specify the credentials.
+
Make sure that a GCP Marketplace subscription is in place.
+

. *Services*: Leave the Backup to Cloud service enabled and click *Continue*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_to_gcp.png[Shows the Backup to Cloud option in the working environment wizard.]

. Complete the pages in the wizard to deploy the system as described in link:task_deploying_gcp.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP].

.Result

Backup to Cloud is enabled on the system and backs up the volume you created every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies.

You can link:task_managing_backups.html[start and stop backups for additional volumes or change the backup schedule^] and you can link:task_restore_backups.html[restore entire volumes from a backup file^].

== Enabling Backup to Cloud on an existing system

You can enable Backup to Cloud at any time directly from the working environment.

.Steps

. Select the working environment and click *Activate* next to the Backup to Cloud service in the right-panel.
+
image:screenshot_backup_to_s3_icon.gif[A screenshot that shows the Backup to Cloud Settings button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. Select the Google Cloud Project where you want the Google Cloud Storage bucket to be created for backups, and click *Continue*. This can be a different Project than where the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system resides.
+
image:screenshot_backup_provider_settings_gcp.png[A screenshot that shows the cloud provider details when backing up volumes from a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system installed on GCP to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.]
+
Note that the Project must have a Service Account that has the predefined Storage Admin role, and that you cannot change the Project after the service has started.

. In the _Define Policy_ page, select the backup schedule and retention value and click *Continue*.
+
